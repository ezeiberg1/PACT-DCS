# PACT-DCS
The purpose of this project was to design a PACT+DCS system to optimize ischemic stroke detection. PACT (photoacoustic computed tomography) utilizes the photoacoustic effect to image blood vessels and has been shown to offer high-resolution images of structures a couple of centimeters below the skinâ€™s surface. DCS (diffuse correlation spectroscopy) measures the scattering of light from blood cells, providing information about the blood flow rate. Since PACT offers information about the anatomical structure of blood vessels and DCS provides information about blood flow, combining these modalities gives doctors a fast, non-invasive way to see if and where a blood clot has occurred. We used MATLAB to simulate how this system would work and imaged a human head phantom to evaluate system performance.
